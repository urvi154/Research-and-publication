📌 The Project
To move beyond theoretical comparisons, this research involved developing an identical 3D cube-solving game on both Unity and Unreal Engine. This "parallel development" approach provided concrete data on how each engine handles identical assets and logic.

📊 Key Comparisons

-Visual Fidelity: Unreal Engine demonstrated superior rendering, realistic lighting, and richer textures compared to Unity's flatter shading.
-Performance: Unity maintained higher frame time consistency (stable 9-10 ms), while Unreal showed more variation (8-16 ms) with occasional stuttering spikes.
-Memory: Unity used roughly half the memory of Unreal (750-850MB vs 1000-2000MB) but fluctuated more frequently during data cleanup.
-Workflow: Unity offered a more intuitive interface and quicker iteration for rapid prototyping. Unreal had a steeper learning curve but offered robust visual scripting via Blueprints.

💡 Quick Recommendation

-Choose Unreal for high-end graphics, large open worlds, and teams skilled in C++.
-Choose Unity for mobile games, 2D projects, rapid prototyping, and smaller teams on a budget.
